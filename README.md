Cross-compiled Space Invaders in Scala for JVM, JS. Looking into Android as well.

Project cloned from https://github.com/scala-js/scalajs-cross-compile-example

# Why

Processing - https://processing.org - is a well-known library for graphics work. It has a lively community and lots
of training resources.

ScalaJS gives us the ability to use a modern type-safe language and still ship the game on HTML5 canvas.

# Developing

Install ScalaIde (Eclipse) - http://scala-ide.org

Install sbt build tool and install the Eclipse Plugin for sbt. - http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html

Run 'sbt eclipse' - this will create 2 eclipse projects. Open both projects in Eclipse.
